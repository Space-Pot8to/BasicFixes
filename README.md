# BasicFixes
Starting in 1.8 parties will take on way too much grain and fish after looting enemy parties and they become overburdened to the point that their speed is reduced to the absolute minimum. Obviously this kills gameplay as victorious parties are reduced to a crawl while fresh parties are unaffected. This mod fixes this  problem by discarding excess food immediately after loot is transferred to an AI party to the point that the party is no longer overburdened. For parties that have already become overburdened, this mod also discards the excess food they carry as well, so should work to correct saved games as well. If an AI party is overburdened for some other reason than food, it won't be affected.

I call this mod BasicFixes since there's one or two more problems I'd like to fix, but since this was an easy one, and since a lot of people are having the same problem, I figured I'd get this out asap.

## What it fixes
- Fixes AI taking on too much food and becoming overburdened
- Fixes AI being stuck going to a settlement they can't recruit from
